A Simple, Smart Way to Reduce Food Waste and Help Farmers Earn More.

FreshCycle is a digital platform that helps small farmers sell their produce before it spoils.
Many farmers grow crops like tomatoes and leafy vegetables, but they lose a large portion of their harvest before finding a buyer. FreshCycle solves this problem by:

- Combining (aggregating) produce from many small farmers
- Creating large bulk lots
- Matching those bulk lots with buyers
- Coordinating logistics quickly
- Redirecting surplus produce before it spoils
